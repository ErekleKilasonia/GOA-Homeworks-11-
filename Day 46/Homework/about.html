      <h2>How often do cyber attacks occur?</h2>
      <p>
        Cyber attacks hit businesses every day. Former Cisco CEO John Chambers
        once said, “There are two types of companies: those that have been<br>
        hacked, and those who don’t yet know they have been hacked.” According
        to the Cisco Annual Cybersecurity Report, the total volume of events
        has<br>
        increased almost fourfold between January 2016 and October 2017.

      <h2>Why do people launch cyber attacks?</h2>
      <p>
        Cybercrime has increased every year as people try to benefit from
        vulnerable business systems. Often, attackers are looking for ransom: 53
        percent<br>
        of cyber attacks resulted in damages of $500,000 or more.<br><br>
        Cyberthreats can also be launched with ulterior motives. Some attackers
        look to obliterate systems and data as a form of “hacktivism.”
      </p>
      <h2>What is a botnet?</h2>
      <p>A botnet is a network of devices that has been infected with malicious software, such as a virus. Attackers can control a botnet as a group without the<br> owner’s knowledge with the goal of increasing the magnitude of their attacks. Often, a botnet is used to overwhelm systems in a distributed-denial-<br>of-service attack (DDoS) attack.</p>
